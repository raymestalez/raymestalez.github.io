        <hr />
	<p>This is a list of the best resources about AI that I could find on the web.
It will be the most useful for beginners, people who want to learn this field, but don't
know where to start.</p>
<p>I have developed a strategy for myself, for learning the basics of AI in the
fastest and most practical way, and I'm sure it will be useful to you as well.</p>
<p>Here's the list of the best resources to begin learning AI with:</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h3>Lisp and Python - best programming languages for AI:</h3>
<p>Of all the programming languages you can choose to practice AI there are 2 best
options: Lisp and Python. Lisp was created specifically for creating AI, and it
is widely considered to be the most elegant and brilliant programming language
ever.  </p>
<p>Here's the best way to learn it:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Land-Lisp-Learn-Program-Game/dp/1593272812/">Land of Lisp</a>"
  (Book about lisp with some AI algorithms)<br />
  This is an excellent and very fun introduction to lisp, makes learning very
  enjoyable, understandable, and includes a lot of algorithms and basic principles
  that will be very useful when you will be going throuhg AIMA.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul Graham <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ANSI-Common-LISP-Paul-Graham/dp/0133708756">ANSI Common Lisp</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's my favorite book on python:  </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.diveintopython3.net/">Dive Into Python 3</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>General Coputer Science</h3>
<p>(algorithms, data structures, complexity)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY&amp;list=PLE18841CABEA24090#t=253">MIT course</a>
(based on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871">SICP book</a>)<br />
  This is a course on lisp and basics of computer science, based on one of the most influential and seminal books in CS - "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Math</h3>
<p>My favorite resource for learning the basics of math is Khan Academy.
Here's the very basics of math that you need to begin learning AI:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2">Algebra 2</a>(logarithms, complex numbers)  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD6DA74C1DBF770E7">Trigonometry</a>  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL19E79A0638C8D449">Calculus</a>  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFD0EB975BA0CC1E0">Linear Algebra</a>  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC58778F28211FA19">Probability</a>
&amp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1328115D3D8A2566">Statistics</a>  </li>
<li>Introductory logic</li>
</ul>
<h3>General overview of the field, most important topics:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Edition/dp/0136042597">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (AIMA)</a>"<br />
  This is the best book about AI, and one of the best books written on any topic. Ever. It may be challenging for a complete beginner, but it covers most of the topics and fields of AI, and if you will read it - you will have a very solid foundations of the field. This is definitely a best place to start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshmLD2MsyqAKBx8ctivb5Q/videos">Artificial Intelligence course</a> from UC Berkeley(CS 188)<br />
  (link above leads to the youtube channel with my favorite version of the course, here's the <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/classes/cs188/f14/lecture_videos.html">alternative list of lectures</a>, which is the official course page that lists all the recordings of this course)<br />
  This is an excellent course from Berkeley, series of video lectures, a lot of them are based on AIMA, it is a perfect complement to the book, it will make it much more understandable and enjoyable to read. Plus there's great practical projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Machine Learning.:</h3>
<p>Machine learning is the most "practical" and immediately useful subfield of AI,
which is great because focusing on learning it will allow you immediately
benefit from, and apply your knowledge on practical projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Andrew Ng:</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/">https://www.coursera.org/course/</a>  </p>

<li>
<p><strong>Programming Collective Intelligence</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/05965293">http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/05965293</a>  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How mind works:</h3>
<p>On the opposite end of a spectrum - here's some fantastic(and very entertaining)
books about how human mind works. It is not necessary very practical, but they
are very exciting and fun to read, and obviously understanding of human brain
can be very useful. At the very least - you will be inspired and enjoy reading
them a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jeff Hawkins - On Intelligence<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533">http://www.amazon.com/On-Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533</a><br />
  Audiobook: <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/On-Intelligence-Audiobook/B002V8LK">http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/On-Intelligence-Audiobook/B002V8LK</a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ray Kurzweil - How to Create a Mind:<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0143124048/">http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0143124048/</a><br />
  Audiobook: <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/How-to-Create-a-Mind-Audiobook/B009S7OKJ">http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/How-to-Create-a-Mind-Audiobook/B009S7OKJ</a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Principles of Neural Science<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Neural-Science-Edition-Kandel/dp/00713901">http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Neural-Science-Edition-Kandel/dp/00713901</a><br />
    This is the best book I could find that goes in depth into NS. 2 books above presented the general theories how mind works, this one talks about hardcore science, neuro-anatomy and such. Very interesting, but also very long - I'm still reading it.</p>

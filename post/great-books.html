	<h3>Catch Me If You Can by Frank Abagnale</h3>
<p>I remember disliking the movie, but the book is brilliant and hilarious. Autobiography of one of the boldest, horniest, and most brilliant con artists.</p>
<h3>Ghost In The Wires by Kevin Mitnick</h3>
<p>On the same topic, autobiography of a great hacker. Extremely clever and awesome. I bet people here will love it.</p>
<h3>Zero to One by Peter Thiel</h3>
<p>Very intelligent and inspiring book about startups and new technologies. A lot of new and great ideas, I've enjoyed it a lot.</p>
<h3>iWoz</h3>
<p>Autobiography of Steve Wozniak. Also wonderful and super positive and inspiring story.</p>
<h3>Trust me, I'm lying.</h3>
<p>Book about how modern social media is being manipulated. Short and interesting. Makes you think differently about what you read on the internet.</p>
<h3>On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins</h3>
<p>Theory of how human mind works. Must read for everyone who is into AI, but also a great book for everyone else.</p>
